    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="desc">
      Amidst the pandemic in 2020, Christian Nunez found solace in creating
      replicas of Cal Poly Pomona's iconic CLA Building. Just like any other
      student, Christian struggled as the world shifted into visual learning as
      he navigates through zoom meetings, dalgona coffees, and his mental
      health. He began to produce and sell 3D-printed models of the CLA
      Building, and on July 18 2020, his store, called Flipped Dimension, was
      established on Etsy.
