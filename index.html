      <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
      <p>
        Amidst the pandemic in 2020, Christian Nunez found solace in creating
        replicas of Cal Poly Pomona's iconic CLA Building. Just like any other
        student, Christian struggled as the world shifted into visual learning
        as he navigates through zoom meetings, dalgona coffees, and his mental
        health. He began to produce and sell 3D-printed models of the CLA
        Building, and on July 18 2020, his store, called Flipped Dimension, was
        established on Etsy. <br />
        <br />
        Two years into the pandemic, the Cal Poly Community came to appreciate
        Christian's creativity. His chibi bronco stickers plastered on many
        hydroflasks— a way many students represent their major. A CLA pencil
        holder adorning students' desk in their dorms. A CPP jettag (and MT. SAC
        too!) for the car guys. A tote bag for the girls and gays. Today, you
        can find Christian on campus by the library—stickers and the memory of
        our pointy building available in different sizes.
